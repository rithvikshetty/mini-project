    <h1>Welcome To Student Engagement Analysis Model</h1>
    <p>This is prototype model for the Mini Project 2021. We have built a model for analysis of student engagement level in classroom. </p>
    <p>For analysis purpose you will have to upload the csv file of facial expressions of a student generated by the 'OpenFace' software and that will be used as input for our model to predict the engagement level in classrooms.</p>
    <p>Here, we have currently built a product-based model for the project but the main aim is to convert it to a research based study and improve the efficiency of the model.</p>

    <h3>Procedure :-</h3>
